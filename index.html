        <p id="tribute-info">Joel Miller was born on September 26, 1984-1985, and is the older brother of Tommy. Growing up in Texas, Joel raised his younger brother, something that was hard to do.

At some point of his life, Joel married his future wife, and later, the couple had their first and only daughter, Sarah, born in 2001.

Shortly after Sarah's birth, Joel and his wife divorced, and the woman then left and never returned.

As a result of having to take care of a child, Joel couldn't attend college, or inspire to be a singer. Joel raised Sarah through adulthood, living in a two-story house, and spent much quality time with her. He worked as a carpenter in construction, and was ambitious to start his own business, as their is a book on starting one in his home.</p>
